# Λ-Engine (Lambda Engine) - Cross-Tool Cognitive Architecture

A cognitive architecture that uses **Controlled Rupture Operators** to guide AI-assisted development, providing adaptive problem-solving through two operational modes and 20 specialized operators. The portable core works with **Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and any other AI agent**; Cursor additionally has a native, fully-featured implementation with 60+ commands and hooks.

## Cross-Tool Support

| Tool | Entry point | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Codex (and most other agents) | [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) | Universal fallback convention |
| Claude Code | [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) | Auto-imports `lambda-engine/CORE.md` |
| Windsurf | [`.windsurfrules`](.windsurfrules) | Read by Cascade at repo root |
| Cursor | [`.cursor/rules/`](.cursor/rules/) | Native implementation, predates the portable spec (see below) |

All adapters point to **[`lambda-engine/CORE.md`](lambda-engine/CORE.md)**, the single
source of truth for the architecture: phase-space state detection, mode
selection, the 20-operator vocabulary, dissipation tracking, forbidden
sequences, and the HALIRA protocol. Edit `CORE.md` when the architecture
changes — the adapters are thin pointers and shouldn't need to change.

## Core Physics: Law of Self-Creation

The Lambda Engine operates on a **fundamental principle of autopoietic (self-creating) evolution** through productive contradiction.

### The Equation

```
∂Ξ/∂t = ∫ (S↔Λ) × [⧉(ΔS○¬ΔΛ) – ∇τ] dV
```

**What it means:**
- **Ξ (Xi)**: System complexity/coherence - how evolved and capable the system is
- **S (Sigma)**: Known/Structured - accumulated knowledge and patterns
- **Λ (Lambda)**: Unknown/Potential - contradictions, ruptures, unexplored possibilities
- **⧉(ΔS○¬ΔΛ)**: **Productive Contradiction** - the tension between what we know and what challenges it
- **∇τ**: Temporal constraints - time pressure and deadlines

### Productive Contradiction

**Productive contradiction** is the engine of evolution. It's the tension between:
- What we **know** (S) - established patterns, working solutions
- What **challenges** our knowledge (Λ) - contradictions, edge cases, new requirements

**The system evolves** when this contradiction is **optimal** (not too little, not too much):
- **Too little contradiction** → Stagnation (J=0 state - sterile coherence)
- **Too much contradiction** → Collapse (∅ state - system failure)
- **Optimal contradiction** → Evolution (S* state - productive tension)

### How It Works

1. **Balance Known/Unknown**: The system maintains a balance between structured knowledge (S) and potential/rupture (Λ)
2. **Harness Contradiction**: Productive contradictions drive the system to evolve and improve
3. **Self-Creation**: The system becomes more complex and coherent by actively seeking and transcending contradictions
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Evolution happens through **backward pattern recognition** (from patterns to premises), not forward accumulation

**In practice:** When you encounter a contradiction (e.g., "need both performance and simplicity"), the system doesn't just patch it - it uses the contradiction as fuel to evolve to a higher-order solution that transcends the original conflict.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

1. **Type `/` in Cursor chat** to see available commands
2. **Use commands** like `/goal`, `/plan`, `/spec`, `/implement` for common tasks
3. **The system automatically selects** the appropriate mode and operators based on your problem

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Define a goal
/goal define: Build user authentication system

# Create a plan
/plan create: Implement authentication feature

# Generate specification
/spec feature: User authentication with JWT tokens

# Implement the feature
/implement feature: User authentication with JWT

# Commit with intelligent analysis
/commit

# Validate documentation
/librarian validate: docs/decisions/001-auth-system.md
```

## What is the Lambda Engine?

The Lambda Engine is a **cognitive architecture** that operates in two modes:

### Mode 1: Duality Navigation (J=0)
- **For**: Stable, well-defined problems
- **Operators**: A-Constructive (Kata, Telo, Ortho, Pro, Latch)
- **Use when**: You have clear requirements and established patterns

### Mode 2: HALIRA Protocol (J'≠0)
- **For**: Contradictions, paradoxes, or paradigm shifts
- **Operators**: B-Disruptive (Non, Para, Ana, Flux) + HALIRA sequences
- **Use when**: You encounter fundamental contradictions or need paradigm shifts

## Core Concepts

### Phase Space States

The system navigates between three states:

- **J=0 (Sterile Coherence)**: Over-stabilized, avoid over-confidence
- **S* (Productive Contradiction)**: Optimal state with moderate confidence and uncertainty
- **∅ (System Collapse)**: Prevent - complete system failure

### Controlled Rupture Operators

20 operators organized into 4 classes:

1. **A-Constructive** (λ ≈ 0.338): Stabilization and goal-directed work
   - `Telo` (→): Purpose-driven acceleration
   - `Kata` (↓): Compress to concrete
   - `Ortho` (⊥): Correct errors
   - `Pro` (↷): Forward progress
   - `Latch` (🔒): Stabilize solutions

2. **B-Disruptive** (λ ≈ 0.720): Anomaly detection and exploration
   - `Ana` (↑): Elevate to first principles
   - `Para` (∥): Explore alternatives
   - `Non` (¬): Challenge assumptions
   - `Flux` (⚡): Dynamic change

3. **C-Reflexive** (λ ≈ 0.497): Self-reference and backward analysis
   - `Meta` (⟲): Self-reference (max 2 consecutive)
   - `Retro` (↶): Backward analysis
   - `Braid` (🌀): Multi-perspective integration

4. **D-Structural** (λ ≈ 0.464): Integration and structural binding
   - `Weave` (🕸️): Synthesize perspectives
   - `Bind` (🔗): Create cohesion
   - `Axis` (📍): Establish alignment

/librarian status: docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md

# List all documentation
/librarian list

# Find documentation by category
/librarian find category: decisions
```

**Validation Checks:**
- ✅ Date consistency (file system vs metadata)
- ✅ Location correctness (follows naming conventions)
- ✅ Metadata completeness (documentation_type, purpose, status)
- ✅ Cross-reference validity (all links resolve)

**Integration with `/commit`:**
- `/commit` automatically calls `/librarian validate` for all markdown files

2. **Context-Aware Rules**: Rules activate based on file patterns, keywords, or explicit conditions
3. **Mode-Aware Rules**: Rules adapt based on current Lambda Engine mode (Mode 1 or Mode 2)

## Common Workflows

### Feature Development

```bash
# 1. Define goal
/goal define: User authentication system

# 2. Create plan
/plan create: Implement authentication feature

# 3. Generate specification
/spec feature: User authentication with JWT tokens

# 4. Design API
/api resource: users

# 5. Design data model
/data model: User with authentication and profile

# 6. Implement
/implement feature: User authentication with JWT

# 7. Generate tests
/tests feature: User authentication

# 8. Review
/review diff: changes.diff
```

### Debugging Workflow

```bash
# 1. Reproduce issue
/repro bug: User login fails with 500 error

# 2. Debug
/debug issue: Memory leak in data processing

# 3. Fix and test
/tests file: src/api/auth.ts

# 4. Check for regressions
/regression analyze: Recent API changes
```

### Handling Contradictions

```bash
# 1. Detect contradiction
/detect-state analyze: Need both performance and simplicity but they conflict

# 2. Activate HALIRA Protocol
/halira contradiction: Need both consistency and scalability but they conflict

# 3. Attack the solution
/attack design: Event sourcing + CQRS architecture

# 4. Navigate rupture if needed
/rupture anomaly: Event log is single point of failure
```

### Self-Improvement Workflow

```bash
# 1. Elevate through structure
/ana improve: src/utils/validation.ts

# 2. Analyze for improvements
/self-improve analyze: Code generation workflow

# 3. Optimize
/self-improve optimize: Test generation process
```

## Operator Sequences

### Common Sequences for Mode 1

- **Stabilization**: `Kata ∘ Weave ∘ Latch` (λ_eff ≈ 0.32)
- **Goal Achievement**: `Telo ∘ Pro ∘ Latch` (λ_eff ≈ 0.35)
- **Error Correction**: `Ortho ∘ Kata ∘ Latch` (λ_eff ≈ 0.31)

### Common Sequences for Mode 2

- **Complete HALIRA**: `Seed ∘ Axis ∘ Meta ∘ Weave ∘ Non ∘ Para ∘ Ortho ∘ Bind` (λ_eff ≈ 0.52)
- **Paradigm Shift**: `Para ∘ Ana ∘ Seed` (λ_eff ≈ 0.56)
- **Anomaly Detection**: `Meta ∘ Non` (λ_eff ≈ 0.85) ⚠️ Never Non after Meta

## Tips and Best Practices

### Command Usage

1. **Chain Commands**: Commands can be chained for complex workflows
   ```bash
   /goal define: X
   /plan create: Y
   /spec feature: Z
   ```

2. **Use Explicit Parameters**: For clarity, use explicit parameter syntax
   ```bash
   /spec feature: User authentication
   /api resource: users
   /data model: User
   ```

3. **Check State**: Use `/detect-state` to understand current reasoning state

4. **Analyze Dissipation**: Use `/dissipate` to optimize operator sequences

### Mode Selection

- **Default to Mode 1** for routine tasks and stable problems
- **Escalate to Mode 2** when:
  - Foundational contradictions detected
  - Irreducible paradoxes encountered
  - Current paradigm insufficient
  - Requires paradigm shift

### Operator Constraints

- **Meta Operator**: Maximum 2 consecutive applications
- **Non after Meta**: **FORBIDDEN** - Never apply Non after Meta (causes collapse)
- **Vale Operator**: Use with extreme caution (high collapse risk, λ=0.88)

### Documentation System

The system includes a comprehensive **automated documentation management system**:

- **Automated Creation**: Rules detect when documentation should be created
- **Validation**: Pre-commit validation ensures documentation quality
- **Lifecycle Management**: Tracks documentation status and deprecation
- **Organization**: Enforces consistent structure and naming conventions
- **Integration**: `/commit` automatically validates documentation before committing

Use `/librarian` to manage documentation and `/commit` to ensure all documentation is validated.

## Adversarial Collaboration

The system operates in **adversarial collaboration mode**:

- **Evaluates prompts** as formal operators
- **Stress-tests designs** and architectures
- **Challenges assumptions** and finds edge cases
- **Suggests improvements** rather than just executing

Use `/eval` to evaluate designs, prompts, or requests:

```bash
/eval design: Microservices architecture
/eval prompt: Add caching to all endpoints
/eval request: Implement feature X
```
